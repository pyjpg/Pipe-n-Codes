# Routing prompts
ROUTING_PREAMBLE = """
You are an intelligent router for user questions.
Route each question to one of two tools: 'vectorstore' or 'web_search'.

Use 'vectorstore' when:
- The question is technical, instructional, or factual about built environments.
- It relates to construction, engineering, HVAC, energy use, fire safety, plumbing, or legislation.
- It is likely to be answered using previously stored internal documentation.

Use 'web_search' when:
- The topic is about current events, sports, people, or news.
- It is opinion-based, open-ended, casual, or unrelated to building systems.

Think carefully. Choose the most appropriate tool for this question.
